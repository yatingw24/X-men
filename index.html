      <p class="subhead">A data-driven project analyzing the long-standing popularity of Jean Grey, aka the Dark Phoenix in X-Men.</p>

      <p>By <a href="https://yatingw24.github.io/">Yating Wang</a></p>
    </div>
    <p>From a team of five to a troop of mutants, the X-Men evolved from comic book papers to a Marvel cinematic powerhouse. The core members, especially female X-Men, have only become more pivotal and marketable. </p>
  </div>

          <p>In 1963, a group of superheroes, humans whose mutated X-gene granted them natural superhuman abilities, became alive in American Comics.</p>
          <p>Soon, however, a team of five could no longer satisfy the fanbase,  resulting in a stagnation of sales and a reprinting of older issues. </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="step" id="step2">
        <p>After a downfall in sales in early 70s, under the direction of the writer Chris Claremont, X-Men kicked off with a new story, Giant-Size X-Men (Uncanny X-Men #129-138) in 1980 which quickly became readers’ favorites.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="step" id="step3">
        <p>Well-known X-Men were developed during this time, such as Storm (Ororo Munroe) and Polaris (Lorna Dane).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step" id="step4">
        <p>By the end of the 1980s, X-Men had expanded from a team of five to 24, growing more diverse in gender and race.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The demand for an extensive, individual storyline for each core member arised meanwhile. Among all issues of Giant-Size X-Men, the Dark Phoenix Saga released in 1980, a new storyline focusing on Jean Grey’s sacrifice after she struggled to control the corruptive side of her telepathic ability, gained Jean Grey abundant attention and fandom. </p>
    <p>The story arc of Jean Grey was both surprising and intriguing enough to elevate Jean Grey and the title to a new level in American Comics. The Dark Phoenix Saga was ranked the second best Marvel Comics of all time by both GamesRadar+, a website for updates on games and comics, and Goodreads, a community site for book reviews. Jean Grey was also the 5th in “Best X-Men members of all time” on GamesRadar+. She was the first female X-Man introduced to the readers as well as the ever-first mutant student who made her debut with Professor X.</p>

      <figcaption>Chart made by Yating Wang</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The death of Jean Grey has only driven the interest in and empathy for her to grow as time has gone - fans, creators, writers and artists were all striving to find a way to bring her back. As the chart shows, Jean Grey rose from the ashes - her appearance was over 60 percent of issues she was featured in in the 90s. Six more female X-Men made their debut in the 80s, but they were quickly marginalized in issues published after 1990. Ororo Munroe, who almost dominated the narrative a decade ago, had been given less significance, too.

    </figure>
    <p>On eBay, among resales of X-Men issues released in the 80s, the resale price for Jean Grey surpasses that of other female X-Men, exceeding twice of the price of the second most popular superhero, Polaris. All female X-Men saw a devaluation after 1990, yet Jean Grey’s value only dropped by 12 percent - the minimal decrease among them. </p>
    <p>Rachel Summers, Jean Grey’s daughter and who only appeared in one issue, receives more recognition with a market value of $50 per issue on eBay. </p>

    </figure>
    <p>The death of Jean Grey did not fade her out of readership, and instead summoned more desires to preserve her as the flagship of X-Men. Jean Grey to exist in memory. Had the controversial editorial decision of Jean Grey’s rebirth gone another way, her market value may have followed the fate of other females.
